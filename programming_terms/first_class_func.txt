A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language 
are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed 
as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as 
a value to a variable.

For Example:

def square(x):
    return x*x

f= square

print(square)
print(f)

#now we can use the f as a function. like:
print(f(5))

NOTE:High Order Function: when other function accepts function as arguments or returns function
	as a result of it own then it is call High Order Function.

♦Passing function as an argument:

def square(x):
    return x*x

def my_map(func , arg_list):
    result = []
    for i in arg_list:
	result.append(func(i))
    return result

squares = my_map(square , [1 ,2 ,3 ,4,5])	#notice that we are not using parenthese with the func_name
print(squares)

♦Returning function from another function:

def html_tag(tag):
	def wrap_text(msg):
		print('<{0}>{1}</0>.format(tag , msg))

	return wrap_text

print_h1 = html_tag('h1')
print_h1('Test Headline!")
print_h1("Another Headline!")
