#we can use this to create the dummy data that we can later use for input methods for our func.
#hence we can create that from this.

♦how to include random module
►import random

►using the random method in random module:
value = random.random()
print(value)

#it prints the values between 0 and 1 where 0 is inclusive but 1 is not.

►getting the floating point values in certain range:
#value = random.uniform(1, 10)
print(value)

►getting the random integers under certain range:
value = random.randint(1, 6)	#here both 1 and 6 are inclusive
print(value)

►taking the random values from the list :
lst = ['a','b','c','d','s','e']
value = random.choice(lst)
print(lst)

►printig multiple values from the list:
colors = ['Red' , 'Black', 'Green']
results = random.choices(colors, weights=[18, 18, 2], k=10)
print(results)

#here k is used to show how many times random value should be produced. 
#the choices function returns the list of these values.
#weights option represents the likability of the element to be present in the list.

►how to randomly shuffle the list around:
deck = list(range(1, 53)
random.shuffle(deck)
print(deck)

NOTE: Now suppose you want to select 5 random cards from this deck.
	we won't use the choices method as it can select the single card multiple times.
	Hence we'll be using the sample method.

deck = list(range(1, 53)
hand = random.sample(deck, k=5)
print(hand)
