Before running any files, python sets the value of few variables and the name is one of
them.
►When python runs python file directly if sets __name__=__main__

►When we import the python file then this __name__ equals the name of the file 
 itself.

Hence, 
if __name__='__main__' :
	main()
# it checks whether the file is imported or being run directly by python.
