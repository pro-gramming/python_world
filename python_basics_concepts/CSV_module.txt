CSV - Comma Separated Values

CSV files are the ones that contains data in which fields are serparated with comma(generally).
#it is not necessary that data is separated only through comma. tabs or "-" separated file is also 
   known as CSV file.

♦reading a CSV file:

import csv

with open('name.csv', 'r') as csv_file:	#using context manager
	csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)

	for line in csv_reader:
	     print(line)

♦writing to new file but with '-':

import csv

with open('name.csv', 'r') as csv_file:	#using context manager
	csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)

	with open('new_csv.csv' , 'w') as new_file:
		csv_writer = csv.writer(new_file , delimeter= '-')

		for line in csv_reader:
	     		csv_writer.writerow(line)


♦More efficient and real world way of handling csv files: (using DictReader() and DictWriter() method)

import csv

with open('name.csv', 'r') as csv_file:	#using context manager
	csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)

	with open('new_csv.csv' , 'w') as new_file:
		fieldnames = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'email']

		csv_writer = csv.writer(new_file , fieldnames=fieldnames , delimeter= '-')

		for line in csv_reader:
	     		csv_writer.writerow(line)
