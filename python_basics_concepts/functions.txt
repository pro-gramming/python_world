♦ CONCEPT OF *args and **kwargs

def student_info(*args, **kwargs):
   print(args)
   print(kwargs)

# use the above method when you don't know the exact no. of arguments.
*args returns TUPLES
**kwargs returns DICTIONARY

►NOTE: these are also used to unpack the values passed to the arguments

courses = ['math', 'art']
info = {'name': 'john', 'age': 22}

student_info(*courses, **info)
#here * before the courses will unpack the elements in the list and helps to 
   unravel the o/p as achieved in the previous case. whereas
   ** before info helps to unpack the dictionary.
