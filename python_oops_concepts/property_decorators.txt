@property  #this decorator
def email(self):
	return '{}.{}@email.com'.format(self.first , self.last)

#now you access this as :
print(emp_1.email)

►here you are accessing class method as attribute just by declaring the @property decorator.

♦setter is used to set values in the specified way:
for ex:

@fullname.setter
def fullname(self, name):
	first, last = name.split(' ')
	self.first  = first
	self.last = last

#now you can even pass the name of the emp as :
emp_1.fullname = 'Dinesh Singh'

♦deleters
#this also starts with @<property name>.deleter just like setter
#it does not require any arguments other than self.

@fullname.deleter
def fullname(self):
	print('delete name!')
	self.first = None
	self.last = None

del emp_1.fullname
