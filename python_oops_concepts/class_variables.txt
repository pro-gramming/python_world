►when using the class variables you either use it though class itself or you use it with 
   the instance of class, otherwise it'll return error.

►Thing that happen when we call the class variable through instance:
  1. it checks if the instance consist of that attribute and then
  2. it checks if that attribute resides in anyone of the classes it inherits from.

♦Printing the namespaces of the variables:
  print(Employee.__dict__)
  print(emp_1.__dict__)
