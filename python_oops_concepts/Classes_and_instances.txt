they allow use us to group data and functions.

►how to create class:-

►empty class:
  class Employee:
	pass

♦INSTANCE VARIABLE: these contains data that are unique to the particular 
	instances.

► we can seperately create instance variables for our unique instance.

♠How to setup the variables automatically when we create intance is to define a _init_
method.(constructor)

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, first, last , pay):
	self.first = first
	self.last = last
	self.pay = pay
	self.pay = pay

# here the word 'self' is not a keyword. You can use any word here, but it's better to 
  stick to the convention.
# In place of 'self.first' you can use your own variable like self.pehla = first

def __init__(self, first, last , pay) :: here the self represent the instance and is passed
	automatically.

♦NOTE: Every method in a class takes the first argument as the instance of the class.
	And so we usually write it as 'self'

♦If you forget to pass the self argument when defining a method in class. Below error
   will be shown.

TYPE ERROR:- func() takes 0 positional argument but 1 was given.

♠TWO WAYS TO CALL A FUNCTION IN A CLASS:

1. Through class itself:
   Employee.func(class_instance)

#in the above case you need to provide the instace of the class explicitly.

2. Through instance:
   emp_1.func()

#here the instance is passed automatically
